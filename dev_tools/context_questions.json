      "choices": [
        "A. Immediately assist the resident yourself",
        "B. Document the observation and continue with your tour",
        "C. Locate the nearest staff member and inform them of the resident's distress",

        "C"
      ],
      "explanation": "While surveyors should not intervene directly in resident care (ruling out option A), they have a responsibility to ensure resident safety. The appropriate action is to locate staff to address the immediate concern while maintaining the surveyor role.
